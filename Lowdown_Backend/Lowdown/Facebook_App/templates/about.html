		<h2> Who We Are</h2>
		<p>
			Thanks for using Lowdown! This is a Senior Project (CS194) created by Addison Weiler, April Yu, and Sean Scott for Winter Quarter 2014-2015 at Stanford University.

		<h2> Our Mission </h2>
		<p>
			While social media is great, we believe that it's hard for people to get to know one another on a deeper level. Our goal with Lowdown is to help people on Facebook learn more about their friends in a fun, challenging way.

	<div id="paragraph">
		<h2> How Lowdown Works </h2>
		<p>
			When you select a friend to be quizzed on, Lowdown goes to their Facebook profile and pulls down all information, which is why we request so much data. <b> LOWDOWN DOESN'T STORE DATA ON OUR SERVER: EACH QUIZ IS GENERATED ON THE FLY. </b> 
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="paragraph">
		<h2> Privacy Concerns </h2>
		<p>
			We know that the amount of data we request seems daunting. However, we want to assure you that we're not evil, and don't store ANY of your data on our servers.  All information is cleared at the end of each quiz and re-accessed at the beginning of each quiz generation.
